## Project incubation application for Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)

It is the shared view of the S2C2F Technical Steering Committee that
S2C2F meets the requirements of an **Incubation** project within the OpenSSF.

## Lifecycle History of S2C2F within OpenSSF

The S2C2F was first contributed to OpenSSF in August 2022. It joined OpenSSF as a SIG within the Supply Chain Integrity WG. Upon contribution, a detailed IP policy and license review was performed. On Feb 1, 2024, the S2C2F granduated from a SIG to a Project with the adoption of a Technical Charter.

### Mission of the project

The mission of the Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F) project is to empower any software development team or organization across the industry with a clear framework to securely consume Open Source Software (OSS) dependencies into the developer's workflow to aid in mitigating risk against threats to OSS supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities. 

### Project adoption

* "Dell used the S2C2F to build their roadmap." -Sarah Evans, Dell
* "Most granular, and least ambiguous, is S2C2F, which provides real life examples. Love the maturity levels, so they can establish a baseline and build on it over time. S2C2F has so far been one of the more useful frameworks that they can adopt at scale everywhere. It helps describe things in a consistent way to non-technical folks, and has proven extremely useful. The existence of S2C2F has made what would have been a headache for my role, much simpler.‚Äù -Tom Bedford, Bloomberg
